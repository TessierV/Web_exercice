<p>"Explore this small JavaScript exercise that visually resembles a chat discussion interface. Available in two versions, this exercise provides an interesting opportunity to simulate recommendations, a fictitious chat, or even fake announcements.</p>
<br><br>


# Note: 

<p>Keep in mind that the names, texts, their number, and photos are adjustable.<br><br>The photos are generated randomly, thanks to 'i-pravatar,' and if no photo is available, a default image can be found in the 'assets/img' directory. You can personalize the photos by adding 'avatar:' followed by the path in the constants.</p>

<p>Responsive design is implemented, and the change in window size is managed differently using CSS variables in :root, allowing customization of colors and more.</p>

<p>To switch between versions, simply change the stylesheet link in your HTML:</p><br><br>
